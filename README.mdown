This README is currently a placeholder. See [Key-Value Observing Done Right](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/key-value-observing-done-right.html) at [Michael Ash's blog](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/) for more information.

This code is originally by Michael Ash, and modified by Gwynne Raskind to add blocks support, ARC mode, automatic de-registration of observers on dealloc, and multiple keypaths per registration.
